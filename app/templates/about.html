      <h2 class="h4">How the Site Operates</h2>
      <p>
        The Birding Dataset operates on a principle of collaboration and
        accuracy. To contribute a photo to the dataset, users are required to
        actively participate in a validation process. This involves several key
        steps. First, users must validate at least 5 other images submitted by
        fellow bird enthusiasts. This validation process includes voting on the
        accuracy of the descriptions provided for those images. Once a user has
        fulfilled the validation requirement, they can upload their own bird
        photo. However, this is not the end of the process. Users are also
        required to provide their own detailed description of the bird in the
        photo, ensuring that their contribution corroborates the content of the
        image. This system ensures that the dataset remains a reliable and
        trustworthy resource, as user contributions are collectively verified by
        the community. It encourages active participation, fosters a sense of
        responsibility, and helps maintain data accuracy. Furthermore, the
        platform has mechanisms in place to monitor the quality of data. Users
        who consistently provide false or inaccurate submissions may face
        restrictions, including the possibility of being blocked from adding
        more contributions. This emphasizes the importance of data quality and
        the commitment to providing a valuable resource for bird enthusiasts,
        researchers, and conservationists alike.
